# Valentine App

## Description
This is a playful web application that asks the user, "Will you be my Valentine?" It features two buttons: "Yes" and "No." Clicking "No" causes the button to move away from the cursor, while the "Yes" button remains clickable. The design is romantic and fun, making it a delightful experience for users.
